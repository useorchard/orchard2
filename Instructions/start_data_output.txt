ssh orchard1@10.0.1.22 'tmux new-session -d -s output; tmux send-keys "cd ~/Orchard/Data/; screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400" C-m'

-> this command uses SSH public key that is already set up to: 
	send a command over SSH to orchard1; 
	start a new tmux session which is detached and named 'output';
	change working directory in this virtual session to a directory named 'Data';
	send a command through the detached tmux session 'output' to open screen at the address and baud rate listed;  

   C-m finalizes and presses "enter" for the command(s) that precedes it. Without C-m, the command is entered into the tmux session but not executed.

-> I don't know how tmux knows you want to send-keys to the session 'output' without naming that session in the command. Oh well. It works.

-> bash command 'tail' could be EXTREMELY useful for us. It only prints the last 10 lines of a file to standard output. Cool! Look into this more later.
