To transfer files using SCP, the syntax is as follows, depending on the case.


To transfer a file from your host(1) to another host(2):

	scp file_path user@host2:desired_directory_path



To transfer a file from another host(2) to the directory you are currently in on your host(1):

	scp user@host2:file_path .

The "." is a shortcut denoting your working directory.
To transfer a file to a different directory than working:

	scp user@host2:file_path desired_directory_path



To transfer a file from another host(2) to yet another host(3):

	scp user@host2:file_path user@host3:desired_directory_path
